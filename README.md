## Getting the Datasets

Before use, the topologies from the datasets have to be put into their respective directories
(they are not included in this repo).

- Topology Zoo: https://topology-zoo.org/ (use .graphml files)
- SNDLib: https://sndlib.put.poznan.pl/home.action
- Rocketfuel PoP-Level ISP Maps: https://research.cs.washington.edu/networking/rocketfuel/

Note: the rocketfuel dataset has to be converted with the rf2zoo tool beforehand:
